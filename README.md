## About Babel Fish Meetup group

![Babel Fish Meetup](babelfish.png)

Babel Fish Meetup is a meetup group for all languages and technologies that doesn't have their own groups in Belgrade, Serbia. We are here to talk about Elixir, Erlang, Rust, functional programming, databases, algorithms or anything else that sounds fun and interesting.

More info about the meetup: [Babel Fish Meetup @ Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/Babel-Fish-meetup/)

This meetup is powered by JS Belgrade Community ([http://meetup.com/JS-Belgrade-Meetup/](http://meetup.com/JS-Belgrade-Meetup/)).

Why Babel Fish? [Answer is simple.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_races_and_species_in_The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy#Babel_fish)

## Community

Babel Fish Meetup is still small, at the moment, we are using JS Belgrade Slack as a main community channel.

Call for Papers for Babel Fish Meetup from Belgrade Serbia.

We are developers and GitHub is something that most of us use every day, so we decided to put CFP here.

We plan to organize occasional meetups and workshops. Probably one every 2-3 months.

So, if you want to talk at one of the next Babel Fish meetups, here's how to apply:

### How to apply

Instead of sending an email, simply [create a new issue](https://github.com/stojanovic/babel-fish-meetup-cfp/issues/new) in this repository.

### Info to include

We prepared a template issue, but here's a few things that we would like to know about you:

- Your name (first and last, please);
- Your email or any other way to contact you;
- Tell us something about yourself;
- [optional] Twitter and other handles.

And a few things about the topic:

- Talk or workshop title, or at least topic;
- Short description/abstract;
- Preferred language â€” Serbian or English;
- Approximate duration of the talk, it's a meetup, so we are opened for any suggestions;
- Do you prefer small (20-30 people) or bigger (50+ people) meetup?
- When do you want to talk in our meetup? Please check [a list of the next meetups](https://github.com/stojanovic/babel-fish-meetup-cfp/blob/master/next-meetups.md) first.

## Topics

We are opened for anything that doesn't belong to any big existing meetup group and that can be interesting and fun for the developers.

You can do a meetup, workshop or anything in between. Live coding is welcome too.

Check the [list of the previous themes](https://github.com/stojanovic/babel-fish-meetup-cfp/blob/master/past-meetups.md) for the idea.

## FAQ (fake, no one asked those things yet)

1. _Can I present our meetup/conference/free course on your meetup?_

   Yes. If it's something cool (and if you want to give some free tickets :)) you are more than welcome to present your meetup/conference/anything else. Send us an [email](mailto:jsbelgradeorg@gmail.com) or [create an issue](https://github.com/stojanovic/babel-fish-meetup-cfp/issues/new) and we'll discuss details.

2. _I never presented on meetups before, can I speak on this one?_
